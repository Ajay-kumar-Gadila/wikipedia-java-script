The JavaScript Wikipedia Viewer project demonstrates the developer's ability to create a simple web application that allows users to search and view Wikipedia articles directly from their browser. By utilizing JavaScript and leveraging the Wikipedia API, the developer has crafted a user-friendly interface that retrieves and presents relevant articles based on user input.

Requirements:

1. HTML and CSS: The project requires basic HTML and CSS to structure the web page and style the user interface. A simple search bar and display area are created for users to interact with.

2. JavaScript: JavaScript is the core technology used to implement the functionality of the Wikipedia viewer. It handles user interactions, triggers API requests, processes responses, and updates the UI dynamically.

3. Wikipedia API: Interaction with the Wikipedia API is essential for retrieving articles and search results. The API provides endpoints for searching, fetching article content, and more.

4. Fetch API: The Fetch API, a modern alternative to XMLHttpRequest, is employed to make HTTP requests to the Wikipedia API. It allows asynchronous communication with the server and handling of responses.

5. User Input Handling: JavaScript is used to capture user input from the search bar and trigger API requests when the user submits a query.

6. Display of Results: The retrieved Wikipedia articles are dynamically displayed on the web page using JavaScript. This includes presenting the article title, snippet, and a link to the full article.

7. **Error Handling**: JavaScript is responsible for handling potential errors that may occur during API requests, ensuring that the user is informed of any issues.
